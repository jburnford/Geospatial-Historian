Some argue that there's not much sense in making public data private.  Sharing non-sensitive data about our urban and rural environments allows researchers and technologists to "hack" and create new ways of understanding nature and society.  An early form of this approach was [Many Eyes](http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/), which offered a platform for visualizing data sets on the condition that the raw data be made public on the site.  More recent platforms are available through Google’s [Motion Chart Gadget ](http://www.gapminder.org/upload-data/motion-chart/)and [Public Data Explorer](http://www.google.com/publicdata/directory) which allow you to visualize your own data Other websites such as Chicago's [Second City Zoning ](http://nextcity.org/daily/entry/sim-city-meets-the-second-city)use a "SimCity-flavored interactive map of Chicago’s zoning districts," to allow "residents to answer the question, 'what can I build on this property?'"  Still, as Hans Roslings demonstrates so beautifully in a 2006 [TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html), publicly funded statistics are generally restricted or so expensive, inaccessible, and boring that no one wants to use them. He attempts a correction in [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/), his free "fact-based world view" website.

Almost immediately after civic data are created they become of interest to historians, and since many have spatial components they can be analyzed in H-GIS.  We support initiatives to share these historical data, and we have written this post about finding, assessing, downloading, and processing publicly available datasets. Several provinces have been very open with their historical data including [Ontario](http://www.ontario.ca/government/open-data-ontario) and [Prince Edward Island](http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/index.php3?number=77543). There's not much point in protecting civic data and even less rationale for guarding historical datasets.  So, please, give us the data!

Contact us if you have links to historical datasets for Canada and beyond, and leave a comment if you found this useful.

The inventory's GIS data are available on [Geogratis](http://geogratis.cgdi.gc.ca/geogratis/en/index.html) at the [1:1,000,000](http://geogratis.cgdi.gc.ca/geogratis/en/option/select.do?id=CB6E057B-0D85-9B22-29DE-6351369A8B02) and [1:250,000](http://www.geogratis.gc.ca/download/cli_250k/landuse/) scales.
