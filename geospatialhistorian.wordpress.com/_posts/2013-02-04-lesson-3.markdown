In this lesson you will learn how to create vector layers based on scanned historical maps.

Open the file you saved at the end of Lesson 2. You should have the following layers in your Layers window:



	
  * PEI_placenames

	
  * PEI_highway

	
  * PEI HYDRONETWORK

	
  * 1935 inventory_region

	
  * coastline_polygon

	
  * PEI-CumminsMap1927


All of these layers should be unchecked except for coastline_polygon and PEI_CumminsMap1927

[![cummins_map_1927](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cummins_map_1927.png?w=300)](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cummins_map_1927.png)

We are going to add a second historical map raster layer.



	
  * under Layer on toolbar, choose Add Raster Layer (alternatively the same icon you see next to “Add Raster Layer” can also be selected from tool bar)

	
  * find the file you have downloaded titled "PEI_HollandMap1798"

	
  * you will be prompted to define this layer's coordinate system. In the Filter box search for "2291", then in the box below select "NAD83(CSRS98) / Prince Edward ..."


In previous steps you have selected and unselected layers in the Layers window by checking and unchecking the boxes next to them. These layers are organized in descending order of visibility - i.e. the layer at the top is the top layer in your viewer window (provided it is selected). You can drag the layers up and down in the Layer window to change their order of visibility. The coastline_polygon raster layer is currently not visible because it is below the PEI_HollandMap1798 and PEI_Cummins1927 layers. In general it is best to keep vector layers above the raster layers.

Uncheck PEI_Cummins1927 so that the only layer you have remaining is PEI_HollandMap1798

We will now create a point shapefile, which is a vector layer. Click Layer -> New -> New Shapefile Layer

	
  * alternatively you can select the New Shapefile Layer icon on the top of the QGIS toolbar window[![new_shapefile](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/new_shapefile.png?w=300)](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/new_shapefile.png)


After selecting New Shapefile Layer, a window titled New Vector Layer appears

	
  * In the Type category, Point is already selected for you. Click the Specify CRS button, and select NAD83 / UTM zone 20N (EPSG: 26920), and then click OK (for information on understanding and selecting UTM zone: [http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/locations/umd/digital/clump_classes.html](http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/locations/umd/digital/clump_classes.html))


[![crs_new_shapefile](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/crs_new_shapefile.png?w=300)](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/crs_new_shapefile.png)

Returning to the New Vector Layer window, we are going to make some attributes. To create the first attribute:



	
  * under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in "Settlement_Name" (note that when working in databases you cannot use empty spaces so the convention is to use underscores in their place)

	
  * click Add to attributes list


Now we are going to create a second attribute:

	
  * under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in "Year"

	
  * this time, we are going to change the Type to Whole Number

	
  * click Add to attribute list


For the third attribute:

	
  * under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in "End_Year" (GIS is not always optimal for dealing with change over time, so in some cases it is important to have a field to identify approximately when something ceased to exist)

	
  * change the Type again to Whole Number

	
  * click Add to attribute list


To finish creating this shapefile, click OK on the bottom right of the New Vector Layer window. A save screen pops up - name it "settlements" and save it with your other GIS files.

Note that a layer called "settlements" now appears in your Layers window. Relocate it above the raster layers.

[![settlement_in_layers](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/settlement_in_layers.png?w=300)](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/settlement_in_layers.png)

Uncheck all layers except settlements. You will notice that your viewing window is now blank as we have not created any data). We will now create new data from both the PEI_HollandMap 1798 and the PEI_CumminsMap1927 to show the increase in settlement between the late 18th and early 20th centuries.



	
  * we will begin with the more recent, and thus generally more accurate, map. Reselect (i.e. check the boxes beside) coastline_polygon and PEI_CumminsMap1927

	
  * in your viewing window, zoom in to Charlottetown

	
  * select settlements layer in Layers window

	
  * on the menu bar, select Toggle Editing


[![editing](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/editing.png)](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/editing.png)



	
  * After selecting Toggle Editing, editing buttons to the right along the menu bar will become available. Select the 3 dot feature button.


[![add feature](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/add-feature.png)](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/add-feature.png)



	
  * Your cursor now appears as a crosshair - point the crosshair at Charlottetown (click on PEI_placenames layer if necessary) keeping it within the modern day coastline, and click (this is always a compromise between accuracy and functionality; depending on the quality of the original map and the georeferencing, for most historical applications extreme accuracy is not necessary).

	
  * An Attributes window will appear. Leave id field blank (at time of writing, QGIS appears to be making two id fields and this one is unnecessary). In Settlement field, type in "Charlottetown". In the Year field type in 1764. Click OK


We will now repeat the steps we took with Charlottetown for Montague, Summerside, and Cavendish. Find Montague on the map, select the 3 dot feature button and click on Montague on the map. When the Attributes window appears, input Montague and 1732 in the appropriate fields. Repeat for Summerside (1876) and Cavendish (1790).

[![att_table](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/att_table.png?w=300)](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/att_table.png)

In the Layers window, unselect the PEI_CumminsMap1927 and select PEI_HollandMap1798. We are now going to identify two settlement (Princetown & Havre-St-Pierre) that no longer exists.



	
  * To locate Princeton, look for Richmond Bay and Cape Aylebsury (on the north coast to the west of Cavendish), here you will find Princetown (shaded-in) near the boundary between the yellow and the blue



	
  * If you look at the following link (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Royalty,_Prince_Edward_Island) you will notice that because of a shallow harbor, Princetown did not become a major settlement. It was renamed in 1947 and later downgraded to a hamlet. For this reason we will include 1947 as the end date for this settlement



	
  * With the crosshair click on Princetown. In the Attribute table that appears, put Princetown in the Settlement field, put 1764 into the Year field, and put 1947 into the End_Year. Click OK


[![princetown1947](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princetown1947.png?w=300)](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princetown1947.png)



	
  * Click on Save Edits icon on the menu bar (it is between Toggle and Add Feature)



	
  * Double-click on settlements layer in the Layers window, choose Labels tab at the top of the ensuing window. Click on the box beside Display labels. In Field containing label select Year (if necessary), change font size to 18.0, change Placement to Above Left, and then click OK


On the northern coast of Lot 39 between Britain's Pond and St. Peters Bay, we will now put a dot for the location of a long lost village called Havre-St-Pierre.

	
  * Havre-St-Pierre was the island's first Acadian settlement but has been uninhabitated the Acadian deportation of 1758.



	
  * With the crosshair click on Havre-St. Pierre. In the Attribute table that appears, put Havre-St-Pierre in the Settlement field, put 1720 into the Year field, and put 1758 into the End_Year. Click OK

	
  * 

We will now now create another vector layer - this layer will be a line vector. Click Layer -> New -> New Shapefile Layer. The New Vector Layer window will appear - in the Type category at the top, select Line

	
  * Click the Specify CRS button, and select NAD83 / UTM zone 20N (EPSG: 26920), and then click OK

	
  * under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in "Road_Name"

	
  * click Add to attributes list


Create a second attribute

	
  * under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in Year

	
  * change the Type to Whole Number

	
  * click Add to attribute list


We are now going to trace the roads from the 1798 map so that we can compare them to the modern roads. Make that you have the PEI_Holland1798 and settlements layers checked in the Layers window. Selects road layer in the Layers window, select Toggle Editing on the top toolbar, and then select Add Feature

[![Add Feature Line](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/add-feature-line.png)](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/add-feature-line.png)



	
  * First trace the road from Charlottetown to Princetown. Click on Charletown and then click repeatedly at points along the road to Princetown and you will see the line being created. Repeat until you arrive at Princetown, then right-click. In the resulting Attributes - road window, in the Name field enter "to Princetown" and in the Year field enter 1798. Click OK

	
  * repeat this step for 3 to 4 more roads found on the PEI_HollandMap1798.

	
  * click Save Edits and then click Toggle Editing to turn it off


Deselect the PEI_HollandMap1798 in the Layers window and select the PEI_highway map. Compare the roads represented in the PEI_highway map (the red dotted lines) to the roads you have just traced.

	
  * We can see that some of these roads correspond closely to modern roads, while others do not at all correspond. It would take further historical research to determine whether this is simply because the Holland map did not sufficiently survey roads at the time, or if roads have changed considerably since then.


Now create a third type of vector layer: a polygon vector. Click Layer -> New -> New Shapefile Layer. The New Vector Layer window will appear - in the Type category at the top, select Polygon

	
  * Click the Specify CRS button, and select NAD83 / UTM zone 20N (EPSG: 26920), and then click OK

	
  * under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in "lot_name"

	
  * in the field beside Year

	
  * click Add to attributes list


Create a second attribute

	
  * under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in Year

	
  * change the Type to Whole Number

	
  * click Add to attribute list


Start by creating a polygon for lot 66, which is the only rectangular lot on the island

	
  * Click on Toggle Editing on top tool bar, and then click on Add Feature

	
  * click on all four corners of lot 66 and you will see a polygon created

	
  * right-click on the final corner and an Attributes window will appear. Add 66 to lot_names field and add 1764 (the year these lots were surveyed) to the Year field


We are now going to trace lot 38, which is just west of Havre-St-Pierre. Make sure that there is a check mark in the box beside PEI_HollandMap1798 layer in the Layers window

Click on Toggle Editing on top tool bar, and then click on Add Feature

Trace the outline of Lot 38, which is more difficult because of the coastline, as accurately as possible. In order to show you the Snap feature__, we want you to trace along the modern coastline (snapping is the process of adjusting the feature you have drawn to coincide or lineup exactly with the coordinates and shape of another closely located feature)



	
  * select Settings-> Snapping Options


[![Snapping_options](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/snapping_options.png?w=300)](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/snapping_options.png)



	
  * a Snapping options window will open: click on the box beside coastal_polygon, for the Mode category select "to vertex and segment", for Tolerance select 10.0, and for Units select "pixels". Click OK


[![snapping_options_2](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/snapping_options_2.png?w=300)](http://geospatialhistorian.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/snapping_options_2.png)

Make sure that the lots layer is selected in Layers window, and select Add Feature from the tool bar



	
  * with your cursor click on the two bottom corners of your polygon just as you did with Lot 38. At the coastline you will notice that you have a much more collection of lines to trace around Savage Harbour. This is where the Snapping features becomes helpful. As you work to trace along the modern coastline it will significantly improve your accuracy by snapping your clicks directly on top of the existing line. The more clicks you make the more accurate it will be, but keep in mind that for many HGIS purposes obtaining extreme accuracy produces diminishing returns.
