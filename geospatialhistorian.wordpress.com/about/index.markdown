The Geospatial Historian is a tutorial-based open access textbook for historical scholars and digital humanists edited by Jim Clifford and Josh MacFadyen. It is designed to teach practical digital mapping and GIS skills that are immediately useful to real research needs.

We published a first series of four introductory lessons to HGIS methods using open source or free platforms like Google Maps and QGIS with the Programming Historian in 2013. We have a second series of lessons using ArcGIS developed by Geoff Cunfer for classroom use and graduate student training and then revised for the web by Louis-Jean Faucher with contributions from Jessica DeWitt and Patrick Chassé.

We are now looking for more contributions on intermediate and advanced HGIS methods. Please contact jim.clifford@usask.ca if you would like to join the project team.
