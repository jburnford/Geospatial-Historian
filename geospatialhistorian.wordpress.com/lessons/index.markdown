## What is Historical Geographic Information Systems (HGIS)?


HGIS is a historical methodology that uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) database and mapping software to analysis spatial change over time. For some historians this involves exploring the spatial dimensions of quantitative data, such as census demographic statistics or infant mortality rates, to identify patterns and see how they changed. Others use the software to give digital scans of historical maps their real world coordinates and then digitize features, such as railway lines or factories. In many cases historians use a combination of the two methods.

For an overview of the methodology see Ian Gregory, [A Place in History: A Guide to Using GIS in Historical Research](http://www.ahds.ac.uk/__print__/history/creating/guides/gis/index.html) (2002). For an example of a historian using HGIS to provide a new analysis of a major historical event, see Geoff Cunfer, ["Scaling the Dust Bowl"](https://esriaustralia.com.au/u/lib/cms/placing_history_c4sample.pdf). The HGIS Lab at the University of Saskatchewan maintain an extensive [bibliography of HGIS articles and books](http://hgis.usask.ca/bibliography.php).


## Programming Historian Lessons (using free or open source software):





	
  * [Lesson 1: Google Map Engine Lite and Google Earth](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/googlemaps-googleearth)

	
  * [Lesson 2: Installing QGIS and Adding Layers](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/qgis-layers)

	
  * [Lesson 3: Creating New Vector Layers](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/vector-layers-qgis)

	
  * [Lesson 4: Georeferencing](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/georeferencing-qgis)




## ArcGIS Lessons:


ArcGIS is proprietary software. It is the industry standard and in some tasks remains a more powerful tool than the open source alternatives. Many universities maintain a site licence that allows students and faculty to install ArcGIS desktop on their computers.

These lessons were developed for the classroom by Dr. Geoff Cunfer and adapted into online tutorials by members of the HGIS Lab with feedback from peer reviewers and the editorial team. They were then fully revised by Louis-Jean Faucher for a class he taught with Daniel Rück at the University of Ottawa. Please use the comments to make suggestions for improvements.
